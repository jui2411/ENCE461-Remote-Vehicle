    @brief  Routines for interfacing to the SPI bus.

    SPI can be simple but gets complicated when performance is
    required, especially with automatic driving of the chip select
    signals.

    To access a device with this driver spi_init must be first called
    passing a configuration structure, specifying the channel to use,
    clock divisor, and chip select pin to use.  spi_init returns a
    handle that needs to be passed to the other spi functions to
    specify the device to communicate with.

    The AT91SAM7S family has a single SPI controller while the
    AT91SAM7X family has two SPI controllers.  Each SPI controller
    controls an SPI bus on which multiple devices can be connected.
    To specify which device on a bus to communicate with a chip select
    (CS) signal is required, driven from a GPIO port.

    Devices on a SPI bus can be configured differently, in terms of
    clock speed, mode, number of bits, and chip select framing.  To
    avoid having to reconfigure an SPI controller for each device,
    each SPI controller supports 4 channels.  For fast access to a
    device, the SPI controller can automatically drive the chip select
    lines (NPCSx).  Each channel has its own dedicated chip select
    line, for example, channel 3 uses the NPCS3 line.  This signal is
    available on several different GPIO pins and thus needs to
    specified in the configuration structure passed to spi_init.
    
    To support more than four devices on each SPI controller, this
    driver allows a channel to control more than one device.  The
    disadvantage is that this slows SPI transfers for this channel
    since the channel needs to be reconfigured for each transfer and
    automatic chip select driving cannot be used.  

    This driver does not use interrupts.  For the fastest SPI
    transfers, DMA can be used (see spi_dma.h).  This requires the use
    of automatic chip select driving and thus only a single device can
    be interfaced to a channel.

    To support additional SPI controllers, this driver uses logical
    channels, where each channel gets mapped to a physical channel on
    a controller. The first four logical channels are mapped to the
    physical channels on SPI controller 0 while the second four
    logical channels are mapped to the physical channels on SPI
    controller 1.
