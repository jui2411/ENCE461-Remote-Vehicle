Perhaps the usb_sbc module is too coupled to usb_bot.

usb_bot requires callbacks for usb reading and writing.  Perhaps this
should be changed to non-blocking I/O.

usb_bot.c has too much MSD specific handling, for example, setup
requests, cbw, and csw stuff.


TODO, if the USB connection times out, say by using gdb, then
removing and reconnecting the USB does not properly work.
